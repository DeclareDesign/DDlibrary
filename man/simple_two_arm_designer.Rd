\item{prob}{A number within the interval [0,1]. Probability of assigment to treatment.}

\item{control_mean}{A number. Average outcome in control.}

\item{control_sd}{A positive number. Standard deviation in control.}

\item{control_mean}{Scalar. Average value for Y(0).}

\item{control_sd}{Non negative scalar. Standard deviation for Y(0).}

\item{ate}{scalar. Average treatment effect.}

\item{treatment_mean}{Treatment mean. Defaults to control_mean + ate; if specified overrides ate}

\item{treatment_sd}{Non negative scalar. Standard deviation on Y(1) potential outcomes. Defaults to standard deviation of Y(0) potential outcomes}

\item{rho}{scalar in [0,1]. Correlation between Y(0) and Y(1)}

\value{
A function that returns a design.
}
\description{
This designer builds a design with one treatment and one control arm.
Treatment effects can be specified either by providing \code{control_mean} and \code{treatment_mean}
or by specifying an \code{ate}.
}
\details{
Note: Units are assigned to treatment using complete random assignment. Potential outcomes follow a normal distribution.
