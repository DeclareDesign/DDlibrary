\title{Create a design for cluster random sampling}
\usage{
cluster_sampling_designer(n_clusters = 100, n_subjects_per_cluster = 10,
  icc = 0.2, N_clusters = 1000, N_subjects_per_cluster = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_clusters}{An integer. Number of clusters to sample.}

\item{n_subjects_per_cluster}{An integer. Number of subjects to sample per cluster.}

\item{icc}{A number in [0,1]. Intra-cluster Correlation Coefficient (ICC).}

\item{N_clusters}{An integer. Total number of clusters in the population.}

\item{N_subjects_per_cluster}{An integer. Total number of subjects per cluster in the population.}
}
\value{
A cluster sampling design.
}
\description{
Builds a cluster sampling design of a population with \code{N_clusters} containing \code{N_subjects_per_cluster}. Estimations sample \code{n_clusters} each comprising \code{n_subjects_per_cluster} units. Outcomes within clusters have ICC approximately equal to \code{ICC}.
}
\details{
Key limitations: Samples are taken from a fixed population of 1000 clusters with 50 subjects per cluster. The design also assumes equal-sized clusters with equal probability of selecting each cluster and each individual within clusters.
