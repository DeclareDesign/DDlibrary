\title{Create a design for cluster random sampling}
\usage{
cluster_sampling_designer(N_blocks = 1, N_clusters_in_block = 1000,
  N_i_in_cluster = 50, n_clusters_in_block = 100,
  n_i_in_cluster = 10, icc = 0.2)
}
\arguments{
\item{N_blocks}{An integer. Number of blocks. Defaults to 1 for no blocks.}

\item{N_clusters_in_block}{An integer of vector of integers of length \code{N_blocks}. Number of clusters in each block in the population.}

\item{N_i_in_cluster}{An integer or vector of integers of length \code{sum(N_clusters_in_block)}. Number of subjects per cluster in the population.}

\item{n_clusters_in_block}{An integer. Number of clusters to sample.}

\item{n_i_in_cluster}{An integer. Number of subjects to sample per cluster.}

\item{icc}{A number in [0,1]. Intra-cluster Correlation Coefficient (ICC).}
}
\value{
A cluster sampling design.
}
\description{
Builds a cluster sampling design for an ordinal outcome variable for a population with \code{N_blocks}, each with \code{N_clusters_in_block} cluster, each containing \code{N_i_in_cluster} units. Estimations sample \code{n_clusters_in_block} each comprising \code{n_i_in_cluster} units. Outcomes within clusters have ICC approximately equal to \code{ICC}.
}
\details{
Key limitations: The design assumes a fixed number of clusters drawn in each block and a fixed number of individuals drawn from each cluster.

# To make a design using default arguments:
cluster_sampling_design <- cluster_sampling_designer()
# A design with varying block size and varying cluster size
cluster_sampling_design <- cluster_sampling_designer(
  N_blocks = 2, N_clusters_in_block = 6:7, N_i_in_cluster = 3:15, 
  n_clusters_in_block = 5,  n_i_in_cluster = 2)
