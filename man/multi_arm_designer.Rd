\title{Create a m_arm design}
\usage{
multi_arm_designer(N = 30, m_arm = 3, means = rep(0, m_arm),
  sds = rep(1, m_arm), fixed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{An integer. Sample size.}

\item{m_arm}{An integer. Number of treatment arms.}

\item{means}{A vector of size \code{n_arm}.  Average outcome in each treatment arm.}

\item{fixed}{A list. List of arguments to be fixed in design.}

\item{sd}{A double. Standard deviation for all treatment arms.}
}
\value{
A function that returns a design.
}
\description{
This designer creates a \code{m_arm} arm design with equal assignment probabilities accross arms.
}
\examples{
# To make a design using default arguments:
 \dontrun{
design <- multi_arm_designer()
get_estimates(design)


# A design with different mean and sd in each arm
design <- multi_arm_designer(means = c(0, 0.5, 2), sd =  c(1, 0.1, 0.5))
diagnose_design(design)

design <- multi_arm_designer(N = 80, m_arm = 4, means = 1:4, fixed = list(m_arm = 4, sds = rep(1, 4), means = 1:4))
cat(get_design_code(design), sep = '\\n')
diagnose_design(design)

If 'means' or 'sds' are defined in fixed list the same definition has to be  given in the arguments list.
multi_arm_designer(N = 20, fixed = list(means = 1:3))
