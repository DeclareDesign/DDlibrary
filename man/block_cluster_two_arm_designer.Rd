\title{Create a two arm design with blocks and clusters}
\usage{
block_cluster_two_arm_designer(N_blocks = 1, N_clusters_in_block = 100,
  N_i_in_cluster = 1, sd_block = 0.2, sd_cluster = 0.2,
  sd_i = sqrt(max(0, 1 - sd_block^2 - sd_cluster^2)), prob = 0.5,
  control_mean = 0, ate = 1, treatment_mean = control_mean + ate)
}
\arguments{
\item{N_blocks}{Number of blocks.}

\item{N_clusters_in_block}{Number of clusters in each block.}

\item{N_i_in_cluster}{Individuals per block.}

\item{sd_block}{Standard deviation of block level shocks.}

\item{sd_cluster}{Standard deviation of cluster level shock.}

\item{sd_i}{Standard deviation of individual level shock.}

\item{prob}{A treatment assignment probability.}

\item{control_mean}{Average outcome in control.}

\item{ate}{Average treatment effect.}

\item{treatment_mean}{Average outcome in treatment.}

\item{code}{Logical. If TRUE, returns the code of a design, otherwise returns a design.}
}
\value{
A function that returns a design.
}
\description{
This designer builds a design with blocks and clusters. Normal shocks can be specified at the 
individual, cluster, and block levels. If individual level shocks are not specified and cluster and block 
level variances sum to less than 1, then individual level shocks are set such that total variance in outcomes equals 1. 
Treatment effects can be specified either by providing \code{control_mean} and \code{treatment_mean}
or by specifying an \code{ate}.
}
\details{
Key limitations: The designer assumes constant treatment effects 
and no covariance between potential outcomes.

Note: Default arguments produce a design without blocks and clusters and
with N determined by \code{N_cluster_in_block}. Units are assigned to treatment using complete block cluster random assignment. 
Analysis uses differences in means accounting for blocks and clusters.

\examples{
# To make a design using default arguments:
block_cluster_two_arm_design <- block_cluster_two_arm_designer()

# To export DeclareDesign code for a design:
block_cluster_two_arm_designer(code = TRUE)
