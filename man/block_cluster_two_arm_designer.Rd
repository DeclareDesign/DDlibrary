\title{Create a simple two arm design}
\usage{
block_cluster_two_arm_designer(N_blocks = 1, N_clusters_in_block = 100,
  N_i_in_cluster = 1, sd_block = 0.2, sd_cluster = 0.2, sd_i = max(0, 1
  - sd_block - sd_cluster), prob = 0.5, control_mean = 0, ate = 1,
  treatment_mean = control_mean + ate, code = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{N_blocks}{Number of blocks}

\item{N_clusters_in_block}{Number of clusters per block}

\item{N_i_in_cluster}{Individuals per block}

\item{sd_block}{Standard deviation of block level shocks}

\item{sd_cluster}{Standard deviation of cluster level shock}

\item{sd_i}{Standard deviation of individual level shock}

\item{prob}{Assignment probability}

\item{control_mean}{Average outcome in control}

\item{ate}{Average treatment effect}

\item{treatment_mean}{Average outcome in treatment}

\item{code}{If TRUE template returns the code of a design}
}
\value{
a function that returns a design
}
\description{
Note: Default arguments produce a design without blocks and clusters and with N determined by `N_cluster_in_block`
}
\examples{
block_cluster_two_arm_design <- block_cluster_two_arm_designer()
block_cluster_two_arm_designer(code = TRUE)
}
