\usage{
block_cluster_two_arm_designer(N_blocks = 20, N_clusters_in_block = 100,
  N_i_in_cluster = 20, sd_block = 0.2, sd_cluster = 0.2,

}
\arguments{
\item{N_blocks}{An integer. Number of blocks.}

\item{N_clusters_in_block}{An integer. Number of clusters in each block.}

\item{N_i_in_cluster}{An integer. Individuals per cluster.}

\item{sd_block}{A number. Standard deviation of block level shocks.}

\item{sd_cluster}{A number. Standard deviation of cluster level shock.}

\item{sd_i_0}{A number. Standard deviation of individual level shock in control.}

\item{sd_i_1}{A number. Standard deviation of individual level shock in treatment.}

\item{prob}{A number in [0,1]. Treatment assignment probability.}

\item{control_mean}{A number. Average outcome in control.}

\item{ate}{A number. Average treatment effect. Alternative to specifying \code{treatment_mean}.}

\item{treatment_mean}{A number. Average outcome in treatment. Overrides \code{ate} if both specified.}

\item{rho}{A number in [0,1]. Correlation in individual shock between potential outcomes for treatment and control.}

\value{
A block cluster two-arm design.
}
\description{
Builds a two-arm design with blocks and clusters.
}
\details{
Units are assigned to treatment using complete block cluster random assignment. Treatment effects can be specified either by providing \code{control_mean} and \code{treatment_mean}
or by specifying an \code{ate}. Estimation uses differences in means accounting for blocks and clusters.

Normal shocks can be specified at the individual, cluster, and block levels. If individual level shocks are not specified and cluster and block 
level variances sum to less than 1, then individual level shocks are set such that total variance in outcomes equals 1.

Key limitations: The designer assumes constant treatment effects and no covariance between potential outcomes.
