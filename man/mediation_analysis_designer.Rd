  rho = 0.2)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{An integer. Size of sample.}

\item{a}{A number. Effect of treatment (Z) on mediatior (M).}

\item{b}{A number. Effect of mediatior (M) on outcome (Y).}

}
\value{
A mediation analysis design.
}
\description{
A mediation analysis design that examines the effect of treatment (Z) on mediator (M) and the effect of mediator (M) on outcome (Y) as well as direct effect of treatment (Z) on outcome (Y).
