\title{Create a simple factorial design}
\usage{
simple_factorial_designer(N = 100, n_blocks = 2, n_per_block = N/n_blocks,
  prob_A = 0.5, prob_B = 0.5, outcome_sds = rep(1, 4),
  control_outcome = 0, ate_A_B0 = 0, ate_B_A0 = 0, interaction = 0,
  outcome_means = NULL, block_sd = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{An integer. Sample size.}

\item{n_blocks}{Integer. Number of blocks, defaults to 1.}

\item{n_per_block}{Integer of vector of length n_blocks. Number of units per block.}

\item{prob_A}{A number within the interval [0,1]. Probability of assigment to treatment A.}

\item{prob_B}{A number within the interval [0,1]. Probability of assigment to treatment B.}

\item{outcome_sds}{A non-negative 4-vector.  Standard deviation in each condition (in order AB = 00, 01, 10, 11)}

\item{control_outcome}{Average outcome in A=0, B=0 condition,}

\item{ate_A_B0}{Average effect of A given B = 0.}

\item{ate_B_A0}{Average effect of B given A = 0.}

\item{interaction}{Interaction between treatments A and B,}

\item{outcome_means}{A 4-vector. Average outcome in each condition (in order AB = 00, 01, 10, 11). If NULL outcome_means is formed from control_outcome, ate_A_B0, ate_B_A0, and interaction; otherwise it overrides these arguments.}

\item{block_sd}{A non-negative number.  Standard deviation of block shock}
}
\value{
A function that returns a design.

\description{
This designer builds a two by two factorial design in which asignments to each factor are independent of each other
If you want a factorial with non independent assignments use the multi arm designer.
}
\details{
Three estimands are declared: the unweighted average of the average treatment effects of each treatment over the two conditions of the other treatment and the difference in treatment effects of each over conditions of the other.

The Designer gives the possibility of including blocks for assignment and estimation.
Treatment A is assigned first and then Treatment B within blocks defined by treatment A. Thus eg if there are 6 units in a block
3 are guaranteed to receive treatment A but the number receiving treatment B is stochastic.

Note: Units are assigned to treatment using complete random assignment. Potential outcomes follow a normal distribution.
