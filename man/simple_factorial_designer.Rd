\title{Create a simple factorial design}
\usage{
simple_factorial_designer(N = NULL, n_blocks = 2, n_per_block = NULL,
  prob_A = 0.5, prob_B = 0.5, outcome_means = rep(0, 4),
  outcome_sds = rep(1, 4))
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{An integer. Sample size.}

\item{n_blocks}{Integer. Number of blocks, defaults to 1.}

\item{n_per_block}{Integer of vector of length n_blocks. Number of units per block.}

\item{prob_A}{A number within the interval [0,1]. Probability of assigment to treatment A.}

\item{prob_B}{A number within the interval [0,1]. Probability of assigment to treatment B.}

\item{outcome_means}{A 4-vector. Average outcome in each condition (in order AB = 00, 01, 10, 11)}

\item{control_sds}{A non-negative 4-vector.  Standard deviation in each condition (in order AB = 00, 01, 10, 11)}
}
\value{
A function that returns a design.
}
\description{
This designer builds a two by two factorial design in which asignments to each factor are independent of each other
If you want a factorial with non independent assignments use the multi arm designer.
}
\details{
Designer gives possibility of including blocks for assignment and estimation.

Note: Units are assigned to treatment using complete random assignment. Potential outcomes follow a normal distribution.
