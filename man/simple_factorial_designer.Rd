\title{Create a simple factorial design}
\usage{
simple_factorial_designer(N = 100, prob_A = 0.5, prob_B = 0.5,
  w_A = 0.5, w_B = 0.5, outcome_sds = rep(1, 4), outcome_means = rep(0,
  4))
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{An integer. Sample size.}

\item{prob_A}{A number within the interval [0,1]. Probability of assigment to treatment A.}

\item{prob_B}{A number within the interval [0,1]. Probability of assigment to treatment B.}

\item{w_A}{Weight placed on A=1 condition in definition of "average effect of B" estimand.}

\item{w_B}{Weight placed on B=1 condition in definition of "average effect of A" estimand.}

\item{outcome_sds}{A non-negative 4-vector.  Standard deviation in each condition, in order AB = 00, 01, 10, 11.}

\item{outcome_means}{A 4-vector. Average outcome in each A,B condition, in order AB = 00, 01, 10, 11.}
}
\value{
A function that returns a design.
}
\description{
This designer builds a two by two factorial design in which asignments to each factor are independent of each other
If you want a factorial with non independent assignments use the multi arm designer.
}
\details{
Three types of estimand are declared: weighted averages of the average treatment effects of each treatment over the two conditions of the other treatment and the difference in treatment effects of each over conditions of the other.

Treatment A is assigned first and then Treatment B within blocks defined by treatment A. Thus eg if there are 6 units in a block
3 are guaranteed to receive treatment A but the number receiving treatment B is stochastic.

Note: Units are assigned to treatment using complete random assignment. Potential outcomes follow a normal distribution.

\examples{
design <- simple_factorial_designer(outcome_means = c(0,0,0,1))
df <- draw_data(design)
with(df, table(A, B, blocks))
get_estimates(design)
get_design_code(design)

# A design that biased for the specified estimands:
design <- simple_factorial_designer(outcome_means = c(0,0,0,1), prob_A = .8, prob_B = .2)
diagnose_design(design)

# A design wtih estimands that "match" the assignment:
design <- simple_factorial_designer(outcome_means = c(0,0,0,1), prob_A = .8, prob_B = .2, w_A = .8, w_B = .2)
diagnose_design(design)

# Compare power with and without interactions, given same average effects in each arm
designs <- redesign(simple_factorial_designer(), outcome_means = list(c(0,0,0,1), c(0,.5,.5,1)))
diagnose_design(designs)
