\title{Create a factorial design}
\usage{
factorial_designer(N = 500, k = 2, means = seq(0:0.5, length.out = 2^k),
  sds = rep(0.1, 2^k), probs = rep(0.5, k), fixed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{An integer. Size of sample.}

\item{k}{An integer. The number of factors in the design.}

\item{means}{A numeric vector. Means for each of the \code{2^k} treatment combinations. See `Details` for the correct order of values.}

\item{sds}{A numeric vector. Standard deviations for each of the \code{2^k} treatment combinations. See `Details` for the correct order of values.}

\item{probs}{A numeric vector of length \code{k}. Independent probability of assignment to each treatment.}
}
\value{
A factorial design.
}
\description{
A \code{2^k} factorial designer.
}
\details{
\code{factorial_designer} creates a factorial design with \code{2^k} treatment combinations resulting from \code{k} factors, each with two conditions each (\code{c(0,1)}). The order of the scalar arguments \code{means} and \code{sds} must follow the one returned by \code{expand.grid(rep(list(c(0,1)), k))}, where each of the columns is a treatment
}
\examples{
# A factorial design using default arguments
factorial_design <- factorial_designer()

# A 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design with unequal probabilities of assignment
# to each treatment
factorial_design2 <- factorial_designer(k = 3, probs = c(1/2, 1/4, 1/4))
