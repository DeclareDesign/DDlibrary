\title{Create a factorial design}
\usage{
factorial_designer(N = 500, k = 3, means = seq(0:0.5, length.out =
  2^k), sds = rep(0.1, 2^k), probs = rep(0.5, k),

}
\arguments{
\item{N}{An integer. Size of sample.}

\item{k}{An integer. The number of factors in the design.}

\item{means}{A numeric vector of length \code{2^k}. Means for each of the \code{2^k} treatment combinations. See `Details` for the correct order of values.}

\item{sds}{A numeric vector of length \code{2^k}. Standard deviations for each of the treatment combinations. See `Details` for the correct order of values.}

\item{probs}{A numeric vector of length \code{k}. Independent probability of assignment to each treatment.}

\item{outcome_name}{A character. Name of outcome variable (defaults to "Y"). Must be provided without spacing inside the funtion \code{c()} as in \code{outcome_name = c("War")}.}

\item{treatment_names}{A character vector of length \code{k}. Name of treatment factors variable (defaults to "T1", "T2", ..., "Tk"). Must be provided without spacing.}

\item{fixed}{A character vector. Names of arguments to be fixed in design. By default \code{k}, \code{probs}, \code{outcome_name}, and \code{treatment_names} are always fixed.}

\value{
A factorial design.

\description{
A \code{2^k} factorial designer.
}
\details{
\code{factorial_designer} creates a factorial design with \code{2^k} treatment combinations resulting from \code{k} factors, each with two conditions each (\code{c(0,1)}). The order of the scalar arguments \code{means} and \code{sds} must follow the one returned by \code{expand.grid(rep(list(c(0,1)), k))}, where each of the columns is a treatment. Estimands are defined for each combination of treatment assignment as the weighted difference of differences of potential outcomes. For example, in a design with \eqn{k = 3} factors, the average treatment effect of A, (ATE_A), our estimand of interest is given by: \deqn{ATE_A = 1/4*(Y_{111} - Y_{011}) + 1/4*(Y_{101} - Y_{001}) + 1/4*(Y_{110} - Y_{010}) + 1/4*(Y_{100} - Y_{000})}, the ATE of both A and B (ATE_AB) as: \deqn{ATE_AB = 1/2*[(Y_{111} - Y_{011}) - (Y_{101} - Y_{001})] + 1/2*[(Y_{110} - Y_{010}) - (Y_{100} - Y_{000})]} and the ATE of the interaction of all treatments (ATE_ABC) as: \deqn{ATE_ABC = [(Y_{111} - Y_{011}) - (Y_{101} - Y_{001})] - [(Y_{110} - Y_{010}) - (Y_{100} - Y_{000})]}, where \eqn{Y_{100}} is short for the expected outcome of Y when A is 1 and B and C are 0 (or \eqn{E[Y | A = 1, B = 0, C = 0]}).

\examples{

# A factorial design using default arguments
factorial_design <- factorial_designer()

# A 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design with unequal probabilities of assignment to each treatment condition.
# to each treatment
factorial_design2 <- factorial_designer(k = 3, probs = c(1/2, 1/4, 1/4))
