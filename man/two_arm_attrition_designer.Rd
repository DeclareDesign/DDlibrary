\title{Create design with risk of attrition or post treatment conditioning}
\usage{
two_arm_attrition_designer(N = 100, b_R = 2, b_Y = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Integer. Size of sample}

\item{b_R}{Coefficient relating treatment to responses}

\item{b_Y}{Coefficient relating treatment to outcome}
}
\value{
A post-treatment design.
}
\description{
This designer creates a two arm design but where a researcher is interested in an estimand that is conditional on a post treatment outcome 
(the effect on Y given R) or has  access to conditional data (Y given R)
}
\examples{
# To make a design using default arguments:
two_arm_attrition_design <- two_arm_attrition_designer()
diagnose_design(two_arm_attrition_design)
# Attrition can produce bias even when not associated with treatment
diagnose_design(redesign(two_arm_attrition_design, b_R = 0:1))
