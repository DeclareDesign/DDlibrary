\title{Create design with risk of attrition or post treatment conditioning}
\usage{
two_arm_attrition_designer(N = 100, a_R = 0, b_R = 1, a_Y = 0,
  b_Y = 1, rho = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Integer. Size of sample}

\item{a_R}{Constant in equation relating treatment to responses}

\item{b_R}{Slope coefficient in equation relating treatment to responses}

\item{a_Y}{Constant in equation relating treatment to outcome}

\item{b_Y}{Slope coefficient in equation relating treatment to outcome}

\item{rho}{correlation between shocks in equations for R and Y}
}
\value{
A post-treatment design.
}
\description{
This designer creates a two arm design but where a researcher is interested in an estimand that is conditional on a post treatment outcome 
(the effect on Y given R) or has  access to conditional data (Y given R).
}
\details{
The data generating process is of the form:

R ~ (a_R + b_R*Z > u_R)
    
    Y ~ (a_Y + b_Y*Z > u_Y)
    
    where u_R and u_Y are joint normally distributed with correlation rho
}
\examples{
# To make a design using default argument (missing completely at random):
two_arm_attrition_design <- two_arm_attrition_designer()
diagnose_design(two_arm_attrition_design)
# Attrition can produce bias even when not associated with treatment
# Here the linear estimate using R=1 data is unbiased for "ATE on Y (Given R)" with b_R = 0 but not when  b_R = 1   
diagnose_design(redesign(two_arm_attrition_design, b_R = 0:1, rho = .5))
