\usage{
regression_discontinuity_designer(N = 1000, tau = 0.15, cutoff = 0.5,
  bandwidth = 0.5, poly_order = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{An integer. Size of population to sample from.}

\item{tau}{A scalar number. Difference in potential outcomes functions at the threshold.}

\item{cutoff}{A scalar number in (0,1). Threshold on running variable beyond which units are treated.}

\item{bandwidth}{A scalar number. Bandwidth around threshold from which to include units.}

\item{poly_order}{An integer. Order of the polynomial regression used to estimate the jump at the cutoff.}
