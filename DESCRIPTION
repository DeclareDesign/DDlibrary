Description: This is a library of functions that return designs built 
    using the package DeclareDesign. In one line of code users can specify 
    the parameters of individual designs and diagnose their properties.
    The designers can also be used to compare performance of a given design
    across a range of combinations of parameters, such as effect size, sample
    size, assignment probabilities and more.
